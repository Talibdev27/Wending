I need to modify the guest management interface in my Node.js wedding platform to display guest comments that are currently only visible on the admin dashboard. Here are the specific requirements:

1. **Data Visibility Requirements**:
   - Guest comments should be visible in both:
     * The main guest management list view
     * The individual guest detail view
   - Comments should be displayed in a readable format with:
     * The comment text
     * Date when the comment was made
     * Associated RSVP status

2. **Frontend Modifications Needed**:
   - Update the guest list table to include a "Comments" column
   - Implement a comment preview system (show first 20 characters with "..." and full comment on hover)
   - Add comment display to the guest detail modal/popup
   - Ensure proper formatting for long comments (text wrapping)

3. **Backend Changes Required**:
   - Modify the API endpoint `/api/guests` to include comment data in the response
   - Ensure comments are properly populated when fetching guest lists
   - Add comment field to the guest model if not already present

4. **Example UI Implementation**:
   ```javascript
   // In your guest list component
   {guests.map(guest => (
     <tr key={guest._id}>
       <td>{guest.name}</td>
       <td>{guest.email}</td>
       <td>{guest.rsvpStatus}</td>
       <td className="comment-cell">
         {guest.comment ? 
           `${guest.comment.substring(0, 20)}${guest.comment.length > 20 ? '...' : ''}`
           : 'No comment'}
       </td>
     </tr>
   ))}
Security Considerations:

Maintain existing privacy/access controls

Only show comments to:

The wedding owner (user who created the wedding)

Administrators

Guest managers assigned to that wedding

Never expose comments to unauthorized users

Additional Features:

Add filtering by comments (show only guests who left comments)

Enable search within comments

Add export functionality that includes comments

Please provide:

Complete frontend component code for displaying comments

Backend API endpoint modifications

Database schema updates if needed

Authorization middleware adjustments

Any necessary migration scripts for existing data

text

## Additional Recommendations

1. **UI/UX Considerations**:
   - Use a speech bubble icon (ðŸ’¬) to indicate guests with comments
   - Implement a "New Comment" badge for recent/unread comments
   - Consider different text colors for positive/neutral/negative sentiment comments

2. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Add pagination for weddings with many guests
   - Implement lazy loading for comments in large lists
   - Add caching for frequently accessed guest data

3. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Allow replies to guest comments
   - Add comment tagging/categorization
   - Implement notification system for new comments

This implementation will ensure wedding organizers have full visibility of guest feedback while maintaining proper access controls and system performance.
